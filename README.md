# mtg-cube-scratchpad
for creating and managing mtg cube lists.

DISCLAIMER:
- This is a personal project suited to my personal preferences.
- Large parts of the code will be AI generated (and checked by a human)

## Plans
- [x] automatic versioning upon push to main
- [ ] different views via iframes and/or tabs and popup windows
  - [ ] communication between views via localstorage
  - [ ] option to save current views and restore them later (use dexie for this)
  - [ ] drag and drop between views where it makes sense (e.g. collection -> cube list)
- [ ] Import/read archidekt Collection
- [ ] Import scryfall data?
- [ ] drag and drop from scryfall
- [ ] Card list Sorter project implementation
- [ ] multiple cube lists
- [ ] PWA support
- [ ] if Import from scryfall is possible, offline support -> this also means having to make scryfall queries work offline (against local copy of Card database)
- [ ] if possible, easy Export to Proxy sites (though a text Export probably works just fine here)
- [ ] cubecobra formatter
- [ ] save queries and partial queries
- [ ] save notes: General + per cube + per card
- [ ] sorting and filtering inside cube lists
- [ ] automatic version check from local app
